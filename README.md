This is a project I made during the Technigo bootcamp.

# Business Site

This weeks project was about creating a buisness site that would contain a hero-image or video, one form with different inputs and one accordion built with javascript.

## The problem

I structured the project so I would start with the header and Hero-image, when that was settled for the blue level I structured the form and then the accordion. I went through all the course material for each of the assignments before I started the coding. I waited with the syling until all main assignments were done.
My first problem in this project started with the content I placed over the Hero-image. It took up more space then the size of the image. I had placed my form below the hero-image and the overflow space from the text covered my form so I couldn't write in the input areas. I asked for help in Stackoverflow for a solution and after that I could solve it by aligning the size of the text with the the hero-image-container. After that I had a huge problem with javascript in the accordion. I couldn't get it to work. I tried to code along with two different parts of the lectures this week but still couldn't get it to work. I approached the problem by bringing it up with my team at Demo-time during this friday and a teammember of mine sat with me and helped me figure out the code. After that I practised it again by doing another lab in codepen so I would understand the code better. I had a lot of messages in my terminal in VScode that I didn't know how deal with. One of the messages was about a deleted picture. So i started to google for a solution and find my answer there. If I had more time I would practise a lot more on javascript. I would also try to style my inputs in the form better and maybe try one of the assignments of the red level. I would also have checked out how my code would look better in html so I can reach the requirments.
